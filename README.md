TODO
------------

* Finally fix messages showing up in different processes once and for all

* Make Hermes work even when the Messages app is closed (I have no idea how to approach this one)

* Fix messages popping up over one another

DONE - * Possible Kik integration, if I ever figure out how to send a kik message programmatically ( :( )

* Refactor into subprojects

* Don't show messages if they're outgoing
